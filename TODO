1) Deal with stranded RNA-Seq
Have a look at the HistoneChIPseq package for the implementation

2) Deal with GenomicFeatures

## using different annotation (makeTranscriptDB)
library(GenomicFeatures)
hg19.tx <- makeTranscriptDbFromUCSC(
                                    genome="hg19",
                                    tablename="refGene")

## easyRNASeq can deal with GRangesList object, so no need to modify it much, i.e. no need to convert it to a RangedData
gAnnot <- exons(hg19.tx)

## REMEMBER we can fetch it this way
## exons(hg19.tx,columns=c("gene_id","tx_id","exon_id"))
## we need to adapt the GRanges then; i.e. multiply by gene and transcripts...

## NOTE that exon have integer ID, as well as the tx_id

## change the metadata column name to suit easyRNASeq
colnames(elementMetadata(gAnnot)) <- "exon"

## finally turn it into a GRangesList
gAnnot <- split(gAnnot,seqnames(gAnnot))

3) Integrate the DEXSeq object generation
## create the disjoin exon
## report both the disjoin exon count and the new annotation

4) use parallel to speed up the process

5) clarify the vignette

6) Add a use case section in the vignette based on Francesco and Wade issues
